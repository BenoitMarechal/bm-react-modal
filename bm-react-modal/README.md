# bm-react-modal

bm react-modal is an easy, fully customizable modal component for React. It was developped for educationnal purpose during my training.

## Install

- In your react app directory, run:

### `npm i bm-react-modal`

## Use

- in a React file (App or any other React component), import the modal by adding the following line at the top of the file):

### `import { BmModal } from 'bm-react-modal`;

(Don't forget the curly braces!)

- Place the modal button wherever you want it to be (mind the wrapping):

### `<BmModal></BmModal>`

- The button should appear in you react app or page, and clicking on it should make the modal pop!

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
